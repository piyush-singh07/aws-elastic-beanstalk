* Now that we have a bit knowledge on how the integration of Data JPA and Spring Boot works, so, lets connect the application
  to a Database as inmemory databases are used for testing / temporary purposes only.
  
* If we want to retain the Database even after the server restarts then we must not go for inmemory databases.  

* In this project also no exceptional handling is been done.

* Components Used:

	-> STS
	-> https://start.spring.io [For getting a starter project]
	-> Spring Web
	-> Spring Data JPA
	-> MySQL Database 
	-> Project Lombok
	-> Dev Tools
